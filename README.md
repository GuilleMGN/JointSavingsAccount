# Joint Savings Account

## Description
A fintech startup company has recently hired us. This company is disrupting the finance industry with its own cross-border, Ethereum-compatible blockchain that connects financial institutions. Currently, the team is building smart contracts to automate many of the institutions’ financial processes and features, such as hosting joint savings accounts.
To automate the creation of joint savings accounts, we’ll create a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. Our smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institution’s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.

The goal is to create a completed Solidity JointSavings smart contract and a folder named Execution_Results with images. These images should confirm that the deposit and withdrawal transactions, which are designed to test the JointSavings functionality in the JavaScript VM, worked as expected.
